seeds the admin setting on a fresh database) and ``src/tasks/processing.py``

# The admin-editable instruction body for CONTEXTUAL speaker labelling — used
# when a recording has no voice embeddings and the app falls back to naming
# speakers from the transcript, constrained to the user's saved speaker
# profiles. This is only the guidance paragraph; the code appends the concrete
# candidate list, the speaker labels, and the strict JSON output contract after
# it, so those cannot be broken by an edit here. It is deliberately the trailing
# (variable) part of a transcript-first prompt so it stays prefix-cache friendly
# (see PREFIX_CACHE_OPTIMIZED_PROMPTS): the transcript is the stable prefix, this
# guidance is the editable suffix.

Only assign a known profile when the conversation clearly supports it; if you are not confident about a speaker, leave that speaker unassigned with an empty string. Never invent a name that is not in the known profiles list."""
